    </p>
    <h3>
       Standard Editing
    </h3>
    <p>
	Text editing in SciTE works similarly to most Macintosh or Windows editors with the added
	feature of automatic syntax styling. SciTE can hold multiple files in memory at one time but
	only one file will be visible. SciTE's initial configuration only allows one file to be in memory
	at once but this can be modified by changing the value of the buffers property. Rectangular
	regions of text can be selected in SciTE by holding down the Alt key on Windows or the Ctrl
	key on GTK+ while dragging the mouse over the text.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are two panes in SciTE, the editing pane and the output pane. The output pane is
      located either to the right of the editing pane or below it. Initially it is of zero size, but
      it can be made larger by dragging the divider between it and the editing pane. The Edit |
      Vertical Split command can be used to move the output pane beneath the editing pane.
    </p>
    <p>
       SciTE can perform commands to compile or run source files with the output from these
      commands directed into the output pane.
    </p>
    <p>
       For example, if <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> is installed on the machine, open
      a new document, type:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<kbd>
print "Hi"
</kbd>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       as that document's text.
    </p>
    Save the document as printhi.py. <br />
     The document should now appear coloured as SciTE is using the file's extension to decide upon
    the syntax styling to use:
    <blockquote>
	<code>
		<b><font color="#000080">print </font></b>
		<i><font color="#800080">"hi"</font></i>
	</code>
    </blockquote>
    Perform the Tools | Go command.<br />
     The output window will be made visible if it is not already visible and will show:<br />
    <blockquote>
	<code>
		<font color="#0000FF">&gt;python -u printhi.py</font><br />
		hi<br />
		<font color="#0000FF">&gt;Exit code: 0</font>
	</code>
    </blockquote>
    The first blue line is from SciTE showing the command it will use to run the program. The black
    line is the output from running the Python program. The last blue line is from SciTE showing
    that the program has finished and displaying its exit code. An exit code of zero indicates a
    successful run. <br />

    <p>
       SciTE partially understands the error messages produced by Python, GCC, Visual C++, Borland
      C++ and other tools which use the same format as one of these. To see this, add a mistake to
      the Python file by adding a second line to make the file:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
	<code>
	<span style="color:#000080;font-weight:bold;">print </span>
	<span style="color:#800080;font-style:italic;">"hi"</span><br />
	mistake
	</code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       Perform the Tools | Go command. The results should look like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<pre>
<span style="color:#0000FF">&gt;python -u printhi.py</span>
hi
Traceback (innermost last):
  <span style="color:#FF0000">File "printhi.py", line 2, in ?</span>
    mistake
NameError: mistake
<span style="color:#0000FF">&gt;Exit code: 1</span>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       While it is easy to see where the problem is in this simple case, when a file is larger the
      Tools | Next Message command can be used to view each of the reported errors. Upon performing
      Tools | Next Message, the first error message in the output pane is highlighted with a yellow
      background, and an error indicator is displayed for the appropriate line in the editing pane.
      The caret is moved to this line and the pane is scrolled if needed to show the line. SciTE
      now looks like this:
    </p>
    <img src="PrintHi.png" alt="SciTE after running Python interpreter" />
    <p>
       SciTE understands both the file name and line number parts of error messages in most cases
      so can open another file (such as a header file) if errors were caused by that file. This
      feature may not work where the file name is complicated by containing spaces or ".."
    </p>
    <p>
       If command execution has failed and is taking too long to complete then the Tools | Stop
      Executing command can be used.
    </p>
    <p>
       On Windows, SciTE defaults to executing tools as command line programs. Executing a GUI
      program in this mode results in that program being run without displaying a window. The
      command.subsystem option can be used to define tools that run in GUI mode. The default
      subsystem, 0, is for command line programs, 1 is for programs which create their own windows,
      and 2 is for using the ShellExecute call. ShellExecute is a good way to open HTML files and
      similar as it handles this similarly to a user opening the file from the shell. 3 is for calling an
      internal extension or director extension, 4 is for calling the Windows specific HtmlHelp program
      and 5 is for calling the Windows specific WinHelp function. On GTK+, the default subsystem 0
      executes the tool and waits for it to finish, redirecting output to the output pane and
      subsystem 2 executes the tool in the background.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Command line arguments
    </h3>
    <p>
       Command line arguments to SciTE include file names, commands and properties.
       Commands and properties are preceded by "-" and are differentiated by the use in
       commands of ':' as the first character that is not '.' or alphabetic.
       Properties use the syntax used in property set files and override any
       properties set in property files. If there is no value given for a property, it is set to 1.
       Double quotes may be placed around arguments that contain spaces but they must be
       placed around the whole argument, not just around a file name, so "-open:x y.txt" works but
       -open:"x y.txt" doesn't.
       On Linux, the standard shell quoting is available.
       The "-p" argument causes SciTE to print the file and then exit.
    </p>
    <p>
       For example, <br />
       <code>
       SciTE "-font.base=font:MS Gothic,size:11" -save.recent ScintillaGTK.cxx
       </code><br />
       starts SciTE, opens ScintillaGTK.cxx, loads the recent file list, and uses
       11 point MS Gothic as the base font.<br />
       A group of properties can be saved as a property set file (with the extension
       ".properties") and the import command used on the command line:<br />
       <code>
       SciTE "-import c:\os\web_work" SciTEDoc.html
       </code><br />
       </p>
       <p>
       A few commands are currently available although this will expand in the future.
       These commands are available:
       <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="1">
	<thead>
	<tr><th>Command</th><th>Argument</th></tr>
	</thead>
	<tr><td>close:</td><td></td></tr>
	<tr><td>cwd:</td><td>change working directory</td></tr>
	<tr><td>find:</td><td>search text</td></tr>
	<tr><td>goto:</td><td>line number[,column number]</td></tr>
	<tr><td>open:</td><td>file name</td></tr>
	<tr><td>quit:</td><td></td></tr>
	<tr><td>replaceall:</td><td>search text\000replacement text</td></tr>
	<tr><td>saveas:</td><td>file name</td></tr>
       </table>
       </p>
       <p>
       Commands use C style escape sequences which include:
       <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="1">
	<thead>
	<tr><th>Escape Sequence</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
	</thead>
	<tr><td>\\</td><td>backslash</td></tr>
	<tr><td>\a</td><td>bell</td></tr>
	<tr><td>\b</td><td>backspace</td></tr>
	<tr><td>\f</td><td>form feed</td></tr>
	<tr><td>\n</td><td>new line</td></tr>
	<tr><td>\r</td><td>carriage return</td></tr>
	<tr><td>\t</td><td>tab</td></tr>
	<tr><td>\v</td><td>vertical tab</td></tr>
	<tr><td>\&lt;ooo&gt;</td><td>octal number specified by 1, 2, or 3 digits</td></tr>
	<tr><td>\x&lt;hh&gt;</td><td>hexadecimal number specified by 2 digits</td></tr>
       </table>
       The following opens /big/icon.txt:<br />
       <code>
       SciTE -open:/big/icon.txt
       </code><br />
       On Windows, the following opens C:\Program Files\SciTE\SciTEDoc.html
       and goes to the 123th line:<br />
       <code>
       SciTE "-open:C:\\Program Files\\SciTE\\SciTEDoc.html" -goto:123
       </code><br />
    <p>
	Command line arguments are evaluated left to right in two phases because
	opening files requires the user interface to be available and there is also a need
	to set some user interface properties before the user interface is displayed.
	The first phase process arguments until just before the first file name would be opened.
	The second phase processes the remaining arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
	So, if you need to perform e.g. a find: or a goto: command on a file, you must put
	the command after the filename, to allow SciTE to open the file before performing the command.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Buffers
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE may be configured to use between 1 and 100 buffers each containing a
       file. The default is 1 and this effectively turns off buffers. With more than one buffer,
       the Buffers menu can be used to switch between buffers, either by selecting the
       file name or using the Previous (F6) and Next (Shift+F6) commands.
       Setting more than 10 buffers may cause problems as some menus are fixed in length
       and thus files beyond that length may not be accessible.
     </p>
     <p>
       When all the buffers contain files, then opening a new file causes a buffer to be reused
       which may require a file to be saved. In this case an alert is displayed to ensure the user
       wants the file saved.
    </p>
    <h3>
	Sessions
    </h3>
     <p>
	A session is a list of file names. You can save a complete set of your
	currently opened buffers as a session for fast batch-loading in the
	future.
	Sessions are stored as plain text files with the extension ".ses".
     </p>
     <p>
	Use File | Load Session and File | Save Session to load/save sessions.
	You can turn on/off "last session autoloading" using SciTE properties
	variable "save.session".
     </p>
     <p>
	If "buffers" variable is set to "0" session management is turned off.
     </p>
     <p>
	Loading previously saved session will close your currently opened
	buffers. However you will not loose your edits, because you will be
	asked to save unsaved buffers first.
     </p>
     <p>
	Opening a specific file from command line overrides "save.session"
	variable state. When you start SciTE loading a specific file from
	command line last session will not restore even if "save.session"
	variable is set to "1". This makes "save.session" safe to use - you
	will never open a couple of files when you are trying to open just
	one, specific file.
     </p>
    <h3>
       Languages understood by SciTE
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE currently is able to syntax style these languages:
    </p>
    <ul>
	<li>Ada</li>
	<li>Avenue</li>
	<li>C/C++/C#</li>
	<li>Eiffel</li>
	<li>HTML</li>
	<li>HTML with embedded JavaScript, VBScript, PHP and ASP</li>
	<li>IDL - both MSIDL and XPIDL</li>
	<li>INI, properties and similar</li>
	<li>Java</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
	<li>Lisp</li>
	<li>Lua</li>
	<li>Make</li>
	<li>Pascal</li>
	<li>Perl, but not all of the language</li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Ruby</li>
	<li>SQL and PLSQL</li>
	<li>VB and VBScript</li>
	<li>XML</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       Running and building commands for some of these languages have been set up but should be
      checked as they will have to be modified to work for many people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Language settings are determined from the file extension but this can be changed
      by selecting anothr language from the Language menu. The language menu can be
      changed with the menu.language property.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Find and Replace
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE has options to allow searching for words, regular expressions,
       matching case, in the reverse direction, wrapping around the end of the
       document.
       C style backslash escapes which are listed in the command line
       arguments section, may be used to search and replace control
       characters.
       Replacements can be made individually, over the current selection or
       over the whole file. When regular expressions are used tagged
       subexpressions can be used in the replacement text.
    </p>
    <p>
       SciTE supports
       <a href="SciTERegEx.html">basic regular expressions</a>
       with tagging.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Keyboard commands
    </h3>
    <p>
       Keyboard commands in SciTE mostly follow common Windows and GTK+ conventions. Keyboard
      equivalents of menu commands are listed in the menus. Some less common commands with no menu
      equivalent are:
    </p>

    </table>
    <h3>
       Abbreviations
    </h3>
    <p>
       To use an abbreviation, type it and use the Expand Abbreviation
       command or the Ctrl+B key. The abbreviation is replaced by an
       expansion defined in the Abbreviations file. You can open the
       Abbreviations file with a command in the Options menu and
       add abbreviations.
    </p>
    <p>
       Each line in the files looks like "abbreviation=expansion".
       An expansion may contain new line characters indicated by '\n' and
       a caret position indicated by the '|' character. To include a literal '|'
       character, use '||'.
       Some simple examples are included in the distributed Abbreviations
       file.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Folding
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE supports folding for Python, HTML/XML, Pascal,
       and C++/C/Java/JavaScript.
       Fold points are based upon indentation for Python and on counting braces
       for the other languages. The fold point markers can be clicked to
       expand and contract folds. Ctrl+Shift+Click in the fold margin
       will expand or contract all the top level folds. Ctrl+Click on a fold
       point to toggle it and perform the same operation on all children.
       Shift+Click on a fold point to show all children.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Properties file
    </h3>
    <p>
       Much of SciTE's behaviour can be changed by editing the properties files.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are three properties files used, a global properties file called "SciTEGlobal.properties",
      a per user file called "SciTEUser.properties"
      (with a dot for the GTK+ version: ".SciTEUser.properties")
      and a local one called
      "SciTE.properties" which may be present in the same directory as the file being edited.
      On Windows, both the global and user properties files are in the directory of the executable.
      For GTK+ the user properties file is found in the user's home directory and the global
      properties in a directory set at build time - normally /usr/share/scite.
      If the "SciTE_HOME" environment variable is set on either Windows or GTK+ then it is where
      both the global and user properties files are found.
      Settings in the local properties file override those in the user properties file which override those
      in the global properties files. Environment variables are also available as properties and these
      are overridden by an explicit setting in one of the properties files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user properties file is intended for customisation by the user,
      leaving the global properties file to contain the default options distributed with SciTE.
      The main use of the local properties files is to change the effects of the
      Compile, Build and Go commands for the files in a directory. For example, I use the javac
      compiler from the Java Development Kit for most work, so SciTEGlobal.properties sets the
      command for compiling .java files to "javac". If I want to use the jvc compiler for the files
      in one directory, then the SciTE.properties file in that directory contains an entry setting
      the command to "jvc".
    </p>
    <p>
       There are commands in the Options menu for opening each of the properties files.
    </p>
    <p>
       The files are in approximately the same format as Java properties files which have a simple
      text format. Lines that start with '#' or that are completely blank are comments. Other lines
      are of the form
    </p>
    <p>
       variable=value
    </p>
    <p>
       For long values, a '\' character at the end of the line continues that value on the next
      line. Values may include the values of other variables by using $(variablename). There are
      some variables set by the environment to access the name of the current file as well:
    </p>
       <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="1">
	<thead>
	<tr><th>Name</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
	</thead>
	       <tr><td>FilePath</td><td>full path of the current file</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>FileDir</td><td>directory of the current file without a trailing slash</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>FileName</td><td>base name of the current file</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>FileExt</td><td>extension of the current file</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>FileNameExt</td><td>$(FileName).$(FileExt)</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>CurrentSelection</td><td>value of the currently selected text but not if selection is
	      more than 1000 characters</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>CurrentWord</td><td>value of word which the caret is within or near</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>SelectionStartColumn</td><td>column where selection starts</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>SelectionStartLine</td><td>line where selection starts</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>SelectionEndColumn</td><td>column where selection ends</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>SelectionEndLine</td><td>line where selection ends</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>SciteDefaultHome</td><td>directory in which the Global Options file is found</td></tr>
	       <tr><td>SciteUserHome</td><td>directory in which the User Options file is found</td></tr>
	</table>
    <p>
       Some features use file name patterns to see which variable to use. For example, the lexer
      variable can be specialised for a particular file, or a group of files based upon wildcard
      matching so:<br />

    <h3>
       Importing properties files and conditional logic
    </h3>
    <p>
       The 'import' statement includes a properties file as if the text were
       inline at that point. The imported properties file
       must be in the same directory as the current file and a .properties
       extension is assumed. Therefore a "import Lua" statement in
       c:\os\scite\bin\SciTEGlobal.properties will import
       c:\os\scite\bin\Lua.properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'if' statement takes one argument which is a
      symbol that may be defined earlier in this property set file or in a base
      property set. If the symbol evaluates to '0' then the test fails. An empty
      string or not present symbol evaluates to 0. Into the very top property set
      is inserted one of 'PLAT_GTK' with value '1' or 'PLAT_WIN' with value '1'.
      If the test succeeds then following indented statements are executed. When a
      non-indented statement is found the if clause is finished. Only simple set
      statements are allowed in if clauses. The evaluation of if statements occurs
      at read time, not at evaluation time.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Command parameters and prompting
    </h3>
    <p>
      SciTE has 4 properties $(1) .. $(4) which can be used to run commands with
      changeable parameters. To set the parameter values, use the View | Parameters
      command to view the modeless Parameters dialog which shows the current values
      of these parameters and allows setting new values. The accelerator keys for the main
      window remain active while this dialog is displayed, so it can be used to rapidly run
      a command several times with different parameters. Alternatively, a command can be
      made to display the modal Parameters dialog when executed by starting the
      command with a '*' which is otherwise ignored. If the modeless Parameters dialog is
      already visible, then the '*' is ignored.

          The classic GUI question. Normally, when SciTE is about to close a file which has unsaved
          edits it asks this annoying question. To turn off the question, set are.you.sure to 0 and
          files will be automatically saved without bothering the user. To abandon edits to a file
          use the New command. New always asks "Are you sure?" giving an opportunity to not save
          the file.<br />
           When running or building a file, its most likely that you want the file to be saved
          first. To enable a confirmation dialog for performing commands in the Tools menu, set

          This zone is defined as a number of pixels near the vertical margins,
          and as a number of lines near the horizontal margins.<br />
          By keeping the caret away from the edges, it is seen within its context,
          so it is likely that the identifier that the caret is on can be completely seen,
          and that the current line is seen with some of the lines following it which are
          often dependent on that line.</p>

          <p>If strict is set, the policy is enforced... strictly.<br />
          The caret is centred on the display if slop is not set,
          and cannot go in the UZ if slop is set.</p>

          <p>If jumps is set, the display is moved more energetically
          so the caret can move in the same direction longer before the policy is applied again.<br />
          '3UZ' notation is used to indicate three time the size of the UZ as a distance to the margin.</p>

          <p>If even is not set, instead of having symmetrical UZs,
          the left and bottom UZs are extended up to right and top UZs respectively.<br />

          output understood by one of the error output passes, as does grep, then the F4 and
          Shift+F4 keys can be used to move through all the matches. The $(find.what),
          $(find.files), and $(find.directory) variables can be used for the values from the
	  Find in Files dialog.<br />
	  There are some scripts that implement this feature in Perl better than grep does

	  <a href="http://jenda.krynicky.cz/#SciteFind">here</a> and
	  <a href="http://www.forusers.com/forme/finder.zip">here</a>.

find.command=cmd /c c:\cygwin\bin\find "$(find.directory)"
-name "$(find.files)" -print0 |
c:\cygwin\bin\xargs -0 fgrep -G -n "$(find.what)"
	  </code>
	  <br />
	  On Windows, the find string can be given to the find command through
	  its standard input stream to avoid problems with quote interpretation.
	  To do this, specify find.input to be the search string, $(find.what).

	  uses the first as the default value.<br />
	  The evaluation of this setting is a little unusual in that each entry in the value

          To support a DBCS language such as Japanese, a code page can be set here. This ensures

          between the two bytes of a double byte character. This option can only be 0 or 65001 on GTK+
	where SciTE only supports single byte character sets and Unicode.<br />
	Setting code.page to 65001 starts Unicode mode and the document is treated as
	a sequence of characters expressed as UTF-8. Display is performed by converting to the
	platform's normal Unicode encoding first so characters from any language will be displayed.
	Correct glyphs will only be displayed if fonts are chosen that contain the appropriate glyphs.
	Tahoma is a good choice on Windows 2000. <br/>

          the distributed properties file although this is just a convention. Some lexers define a
          second set of keywords which will be displayed in a different style to the first set of
          keywords. This is used in the HTML lexer to display JavaScript keywords in a different

          The lexers determine a style number for each lexical type, such as keyword, comment or
          number. These settings determine the visual style to be used for each style number of
          each lexer.<br />
           The value of each setting is a set of ',' separated fields, some of which have a
          subvalue after a ':'. The fields are font, size, fore, back, italics, notitalics, bold,
          notbold, eolfilled, noteolfilled, underlined, notunderlined, and case.
	The font field has a subvalue which is the name of
          the font, the fore and back have colour subvalues, the size field has a numeric size
          subvalue, the case field has a subvalue of 'm', 'u', or 'l' for mixed, upper or lower case,
	and the bold, italics and eolfilled fields have no subvalue. The value
          "fore:#FF0000,font:Courier,size:14" represents 14 point, red Courier text.<br />
           A global style can be set up using style.*.<i>stylenumber</i>. Any style options set in
          the global style will be inherited by each lexer style unless overridden.

          Brace highlighting is a feature that shows the range of a brace when the caret is
          positioned immediately after it. It is especially useful when complex nested braces are
          used. The characters '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', and '}' are considered braces. The feature
          defaults to off (because it slows cursor movement) unless braces.check is set to 1. If
          braces.sloppy is set to 1 then if there is no brace before the caret then the character
          after the caret is checked. The highlighting is performed by displaying the braces in
          style number 34 or in style number 35 if there is no matching brace. While this is a full
          style, to avoid partial display of the braces, it is best to make this style differ from
          the standard style of braces only in foreground and background colour. Only braces with
          style set to braces.<i>lexer</i>.style (which defaults to 0) are candidates for brace
          match highlighting.

          load.on.activate is set.<br />
           The subsystem determines how the command is executed on Windows. 0, the default is for

	by using ShellExecute, 3 for running in an internal extension or director extension,
	4 for running HtmlHelp on Windows, and 5 for running WinHelp on Windows.
	When using subsystem 4 or 5, the command has two parts separated by ! with the first
	part being the topic to search for and the second the name of the help file.<br />
	If the text of a command starts with '*' then the Parameters dialog is displayed to
	prompt for parameters before executing the command. The initial '*' is not included

          says that for C++ the words "if", "else", and "while" in keyword style, 5, start compound
	  statements which leads to the next line being indented if no other factors affect it. However,
	  if a statement end is found on the same line then the next line is not indented. For C++ the
	  statement end is the semicolon in the operator style, so this is defined:<br /><br />
	 <code>
		statement.end.$(file.patterns.cpp)=10 ;
	 </code><br /><br />
	 The number of lines looked at to determine indentation can be set with statement.lookback.
	 This can be used either to bound the amount of time spent on this task or to specify
	 that only the last line be examined for indentation.<br />

       Supporting a new language
    </h3>
    <p>
       For languages very similar to existing supported languages, which may only differ in a minor
      feature such as the keywords used, the existing lexers can often be reused. The set of
      keywords can then be changed to suit the new language. Java and JavaScript could have
      reasonably reused the C++ lexer. The Java lexer was added only to support doc comments.
    </p>
    <p>
       For languages that can not be lexed with the existing lexers, a new lexer can be coded in
      C++.
    </p>
    <p>
       <a href="SciTELexer.html">Installing a lexer into SciTE</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       The open.filter should be modified to include the file extensions used for the new language
      and entries added for command.compile, command.build, command.go and command.go.needs for the
      language.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Creating API files
    </h3>
    <p>
       The .api files can be generated by hand or by using a program.
    </p>
    <p>
	For C/C++ headers, an API file can be generated using
	<a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">ctags</a>
	and then the <a href="tags2api.py">
	tags2api Python script</a> (which assumes C/C++ source) on the tags file to grab complete
	multiple line function prototypes.
	Some common headers surround parameter lists with a __P macro and may have
	comments. The <a href="cleanapi.cc">cleanapi</a> utility may be used on these files.
    </p>
    <p>
	To generate an API file for Python modules, there is a
	<a href="http://stud4.tuwien.ac.at/~e9326522/gen_python_api.zip">gen_python script</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
	To generate an API file for Java classes, there is a
	<a href="ApiBuilder.java">ApiBuilder.java</a> program.

       Extending SciTE
    </h3>
    <p>
       There are two formal extension interfaces for SciTE, the
       <a href="SciTEExtension.html">SciTE Extension Interface</a>
       is for extending SciTE with code compiled into the SciTE executable and the
       <a href="SciTEDirector.html">SciTE Director Interface</a> is for
       manipulating SciTE on Windows from another application.

    <h3>
       Frequently Asked Questions
    </h3></a>
    <h4>
       How do I change SciTE to use black as the background colour?
    </h4>
    <p>
       You need to change the style settings. The main change is in the global
       options file to the global default style and caret colour but you may have
       to change other style settings to make this work well:<br><code>
       style.*.32=$(font.base),back:#000000,fore:#ffffff<br>
       caret.fore=#FFFFFF</code>

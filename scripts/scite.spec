# SciTE code editor using the Scintilla editing component
# SciTE had syntax highlighting and support for building and running programs
#
# This package contains the gtk enabled varsion, distributed as a binary
# tarball from http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html
#
# The tarball is named gscite???.tgz, however the actual name of the app
# is still SciTE.
#
# This package name purposely uses all lower case letters in the its package
# name so that one can issue the command "rpm -q scite" without having to
# remember the exact case of all the letters. However, none of the files
# contained in this package have been renamed.

%description
SciTE is a SCIntilla based Text Editor. Originally built to demonstrate Scintilla, it has grown to
be a generally useful editor with facilities for building and running programs. It is best used for
jobs with simple configurations - I use it for building test and demonstration programs as well
as SciTE and Scintilla, themselves.

SciTE is currently available for Intel Win32 and Linux compatible operating systems with
GTK+.
